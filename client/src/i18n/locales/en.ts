And that's the main thing for me, I don't like rote learning, I prefer to study the language easily and playfully. And at this school you can also practice. Native speakers are invited to lessons, I practice with them. What's also important and interesting is that there's a tea house 'Qinglong' nearby, after classes you can have tea with classmates, read books, there are light comics in Chinese. I RECOMMEND.",
